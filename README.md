# Hello.

My name is Jordan. I'm an aspiring data analyst with a degree in Computer Science. I also enjoy programming in general and have been learning web development for fun in my fee-time. Other than that, I love learning new languages and studying linguistics and history.

Below are my data analytics and web-development portfolios, as well as some random stuff that I'm proud of.

## Skills
### I know
Python, SQL, Excel, Linux CLI, JavaScript, MERN web-dev stack
### I have used
SAS, C, Java 
### I am learning
PANDAS, Tableau, advanced SQL Queries, re-learning statistics from uni

## Data Analytics
    // Still in Development //

## Web Development
I like web development because it lets me apply my computer science / programming skills with a creative twist. I'm not currently looking for a career in Web-Dev. I'm working up to the point where I feel confident enough to do a few personal projects that I have in mind.

### Books I've read lately

**A History of the Modern Middle East** - William E. Cleveland & Martin Bunton <br>
I've been reading this textbook sporadically over the past few months and am half-way through it. It starts with a great overview of ancient history and then goes into detail about the Ottoman Empire, Persia, the states created after the Ottomans, etc. (I'm at World War I as of writing this.) 
**Sapiens** - Yuval Noah Harari
An extremely interesting book that tries to give an outline of human history from as far back as we can go till now. I leared a lot about ancient homo-sapiens as well as other Sapien species that existed. I especially enjoyed reading theories about why we are the way we are (how language developed, the cognitive revolution, agricultural revolution, etc.) My only complaint is that later in the book I found explanations of some things that I actually know about to be extremely shallow and over-simplified, which made me doubt everything else that I read beforehand.

**The Foundation Trilogy** - Isaac Asimov
Some classic science-fiction with some very interesting ideas. I especially like how the book does world-building of a civilization over many years. The series is also a productt of its time. I found it amusing that 90% of dialog seemed to be between men smoking cigars in an office and that messages between spaceships were printed out and then run to the captain's office.
