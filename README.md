# Hello.

My name is Jordan. I'm interested in computer science, analytics, linguistics, and world events/history.

Below are my data analytics and web-development projects.
## Skills
**I know** Python, SQL, Excel, Linux CLI, GIT, GitHub. <br>
**I have used** SAS, C, Java, JavaScript, MERN web-dev stack **but it has been a while.** <br>
**I am working on** sharpening base computer science skills and learning about ML. <br>
**I also have experience** working as a data scientist and in many different service-industry jobs.<br>

## Projects

[Visualizing the affordability of housing on minimum wage over time (by county.)](https://github.com/jmcgallia/mw_housing)

Where to build public transit in the US (public transit study.) (IN PROGRESS)

## Computer Science Articles / Programming Assignments
According to some wise people, you learn best by teaching. Here are some articles I've written about different algorithms or CS topics. I made these partly to reinforce my own learning, but maybe they could be used by someone else to learn something or to evaluate my knowledge.

|Algorithm|Course/Class|Explanation|Tags|
|---|---|---|---|
|Karatsube MultiplicationWrite(.)|Stanford Algorithms - Coursera|A recursive implementation of Karatsuba algorithm to multiply big integers in O(N) time.|Divide and Conquer, Recursive|
|Inversion Counting|Stanford Algorithms - Coursera|A recursive algorithm (based on mergesort) that counts inversions in an array.|Divide and Conquer, Recursive|
|Master Theorem - Overview and basic proof|My overview of the utility and logic of the master theorem, and a quick proof of it as well.| Time Complexity, Recursive, Divide and Conquer, Algorithms|

## Self-studying
I've decided to go through a bunch of online courses that interest me or that I don't feel like I mastered enough at uni. Here are my solutions and explanations for the content of each course. I hope this content shows my mastery of the material and eagerness to learn. I also hope that my solutions/explanations might help other students taking these courses.
