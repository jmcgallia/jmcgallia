# Hello.

My name is Jordan. I'm an aspiring data analyst with a degree in Computer Science. I also enjoy programming in general and have been learning web development for fun in my fee-time. Other than that, I love learning new languages and studying linguistics and history.

Below are my data analytics and web-development portfolios, as well as some random stuff that I'm proud of.

## Data Analytics
    // Still in Development //

## Web Development
I like web development because it lets me apply my computer science / programming skills with a creative twist. I'm not currently looking for a career in Web-Dev. I'm working up to the point where I feel confident enough to do a few personal projects that I have in mind.
